# Single Number

https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/

## Problem description

Given a non-empty array of integers `num`s, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Example 1:

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

## Example 2:

```text
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

## Example 3:

```text
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints:

```text
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
```
