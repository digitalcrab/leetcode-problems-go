# Valid Anagram

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the
original letters exactly once.

## Example 1

```text
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

## Example 3

```text
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

## Constraints:

```text
1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
```
