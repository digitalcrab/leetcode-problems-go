# Min Stack

https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/

## Problem Description

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

1. `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
2. `void push(int val)` pushes the element val onto the stack.
3. `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
4. `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
5. `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

## Constraints

```text
-231 <= val <= 231 - 1
Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin.
```
