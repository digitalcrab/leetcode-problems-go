# Group Shifted Strings

https://leetcode.com/problems/group-shifted-strings/description/

## Problem description

Perform the following shift operations on a string:

- **Right shift**: Replace every letter with the successive letter of the English alphabet, where 'z' is replaced by '
  a'. For example, "abc" can be right-shifted to "bcd" or "xyz" can be right-shifted to "yza".
- **Left shift**: Replace every letter with the preceding letter of the English alphabet, where 'a' is replaced by 'z'.
  For example, "bcd" can be left-shifted to "abc" or "yza" can be left-shifted to "xyz".

We can keep shifting the string in both directions to form an endless shifting sequence.

- For example, shift "abc" to form the sequence: ... <-> "abc" <-> "bcd" <-> ... <-> "xyz" <-> "yza" <-> .... <-> "
  zab" <-> "abc" <-> ...

You are given an array of strings strings, group together all strings[i] that belong to the same shifting sequence. You
may return the answer in any order.

## Example 1:

```text
Input: strings = ["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"]

Output: [["acef"],["a","z"],["abc","bcd","xyz"],["az","ba"]]
```

## Example 2:

```text
Input: strings = ["a"]

Output: [["a"]]
```

## Constraints:

```text
1 <= strings.length <= 200
1 <= strings[i].length <= 50
strings[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
```
