# Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to
`target`. You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element
twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
