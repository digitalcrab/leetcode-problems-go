# Majority Element

https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times.
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

## Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

## Constraints

```text
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
```

## Follow up

Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
